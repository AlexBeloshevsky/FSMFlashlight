Alex's FSM demo project

I chose to showcase a flashlight with the following states:

-off
-on
-blink

This front-end focused project uses styled-components, testing, a FSM, react hooks, animations, and more.

it was created using create-react-app so the usual scripts apply, mainly:
npm run start (for local development)
npm run test (for local testing)
